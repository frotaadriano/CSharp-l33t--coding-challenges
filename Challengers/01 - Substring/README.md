# Welcome to the Substring challenge!

Problem Statement:

> You are given a string of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
> 
> Write the implementation of the method longestSubstring(string s, int k) that takes a string s and an integer k as input, and returns the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters in sequence.

For example:

For this call to the method longestSubstring(string s, int k):

> longestSubstring("abcbdbdbbdcdabd", 2);

The return has be:

> 7

In this example, the longest substring that contains at most 2 distinct characters is "bdbdbbd", which has a length of 7.

Some premises and constraints:

- The input string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `1` ≤ `k` ≤ `length` of `s`.
